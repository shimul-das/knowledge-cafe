            <h3>1. What is the difference between Props vs state? </h3>
            <p><span className='span'>Props (short for "properties") </span>are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. They are immutable and read-only, meaning that they cannot be modified by the child component that receives them. Instead, the child component can use the props passed down to it to render its own UI or pass them on to other child components.</p>
            <p><span className='span'>State</span> on the other hand, is used to manage data that changes within a component. Unlike props, state is mutable and can be changed by the component itself through a method called setState(). When the state changes, React will automatically re-render the component to reflect the updated data.</p>

            <h3>2. How does useState work?</h3>
            <p><span className='span'>useState</span> is a React Hook that lets you add a state variable to your component. It returns an array with two values: the current state and a function to update it. You can use the function to change the state value and trigger a re-render of your component. You can also pass a function as an argument to useState to initialize the state based on some calculation.</p>

            <h3>3. What is the Purpose of useEffect other than fetching data.</h3>
            <p><span className='span'>useState</span> is a React Hook that lets you perform side effects in your components. Here are some other examples of can do with useEffect besides fetching data:DOM manipulation, Set up subscriptions , Manage timers and animations , Call APIs or services and Handle browser events. useEffect accepts a function and an optional array of dependencies as arguments. The function will run after every render unless you specify the dependencies that control when it should run. You can also return a cleanup function from useEffect to dispose any resources that are no longer needed</p>

            <h3>4. How Does React work? </h3>
            <p><span className='span'>React</span> is a JavaScript library that creates user interfaces using declarative code and reusable components. React components are like JavaScript functions that accept input data (props) and return React elements that describe how the UI should look. React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI based on changes in the data (state). React can also be used to build single-page applications and mobile apps with other libraries</p>
